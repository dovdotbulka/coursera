FWIW, for those (other) newbs out there, I found that if you have an existing repo, what they donâ€™t mention in the GH Pages tutorial, is you just need to to go to settings in the repo, then scroll down to the Github Pages section, and then set the (master) branch (this is disabled by default), and save it.

This should create a page you can then goto in the browser. 

 EDIT: theme is optional - I left it off. 

 $ browser-sync start --server --directory --files "*"
